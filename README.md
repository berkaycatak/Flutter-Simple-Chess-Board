A simple chess board widget, with several options.

## Features

![Example screenshot](./simple_chess_board.jpg "Example usage")

A simple chess board, where:
* you can configure the current position,
* you can configure each side type (e.g : we can drag pieces for white side, but block them for black side if we want to make an external engine move),
* you can show coordinates and player turn around the board,
* you use your own widget for processing with promotion piece selection,
* you can choose the orientation of the board (are Blacks at bottom ?),
* you can add arrows.
